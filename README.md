# TeNeS

TeNeS (**Te**nsor **Ne**twork **S**olver) is a solver for 2D quantum lattice system based on a PEPS wave function and the CTM method.
TeNeS can make use of many CPU/nodes through an OpenMP/MPI hybirid parallel tensor operation library, [mptensor](https://github.com/smorita/mptensor).

## Prerequisites and dependencies

The following tools are required for building TeNeS.

- C++11 compiler
- CMake (>=3.6.0)

TeNeS depends on the following libraries, but these are downloaded automatically through the build process.

- [mptensor](https://github.com/smorita/mptensor)
- [cpptoml](https://github.com/skystrife/cpptoml)

TeNeS can be parallerized by using MPI and ScaLAPACK.

TeNeS tools (`tenes_simple`, `tenes_std`) are written in Python3.
The following external packages are required:

- numpy
- scipy
- toml
- typing (mandatory for python < 3.5)

## Install

### Simplest way to build

``` bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

(NOTE: Some system (e.g. CentOS) provides CMake 3 as `cmake3`)

The above commands makes an exectutable file `tenes` in the `build/src` directory.

### Install binaries and samples

``` bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to install to> ../
make
make install
```

Noted that the parallel building `make -j <num_parallel>` can reduce the time to build.

The `make install` command installs `tenes`, `tenes_std`, and `tenes_simple` into the `<path to install to>/bin` .
Samples will be also installed into the `<path to install to>/share/tenes/<VERSION>/sample` .
The default value of the `<path to install to>` is `/usr/local` .

### Specify compiler

CMake detects your compiler automatically but sometimes this is not what you want.
In this case, you can specify the compiler by the following way,

``` bash
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path to your compiler> ../
```

### Disable MPI/ScaLAPACK parallelization

To disable parallelization, pass the `-DENABLE_MPI=OFF` option to `cmake` commands.

If you use macos, MPI/ScaLAPACK parallelization is disabled by default because the combination of Apple Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library with ScaLAPACK seems to have some troubles.

### Specify ScaLAPACK

TeNeS finds ScaLAPACK automatically, but may fail.
In such a case, `-DSCALAPACK_ROOT=<path>` option specifies the path to the ScaLAPACK library file, `<path>/lib/libscalapack.so`.

### Use the pre-built mptensor

TeNeS is based on the parallerized tensor library, [mptensor](https://github.com/smorita/mptensor) (>= v0.3).
The build system of TeNeS installs this automatically, but you can use the extra pre-built mptensor by the following way.

``` bash
cmake -DMPTENSOR_ROOT=<path to mptensor> ../
```

### Specify Python interpreter

TeNeS tools `tenes_simple` and `tenes_std` use `python3` which can be found in `PATH` via `/usr/bin/env python3`.
Please make sure that `python3` command invokes Python3 interpreter, for example, by using `type python3` .

If you want to fix the interpreter to be used (or `/usr/bin/env` does not exist), you can specify it by the following way,

``` bash
cmake -DTENES_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=<path to your interpreter> ../
```

## Usage

### Use pre-defined model and lattice

For example, the following file `simple.toml` represents the transverse field Ising model on the square lattice.

```
[parameter]
[parameter.general]
is_real = true

[parameter.simple_update]
num_step = 1000
tau = 0.01

[parameter.full_update]
num_step = 0
tau = 0.01

[parameter.ctm]
iteration_max = 10
dimension = 10

[lattice]
type = "square lattice"
L = 2
W = 2
virtual_dim = 2
initial = "ferro"

[model]
type = "spin"
Jz = -1.0 # negative for FM interaction
Jx = 0.0
Jy = 0.0
hx = 1.0   # transverse field
```

`tenes_simple` is a utility tool for converting this file to another file, `std.toml`, denoting the operator tensors including bond hamiltonian.

``` bash
tenes_simple simple.toml
```

### Calculate imaginary time evolution operators

`tenes_std` is another utility tool for calculating imaginary time evolution operators and converting `std.toml` to the input file of `tenes`, `input.toml`.

``` bash
tenes_std std.toml
```

By editing `std.toml`, users can perform other models and lattices as ones like.

### Perform

To perform simulation, pass `input.toml` to `tenes` as the following

``` bash
tenes input.toml
```

Results can be found in `output` directory.
For example, expectation values of operators per site are stored in `output/densities.dat` as the following,

```
Sz          =  2.97866964051826333e-01  0.00000000000000000e+00
Sx          =  3.86024172907023511e-01  0.00000000000000000e+00
hamiltonian = -7.57303058659582140e-01  0.00000000000000000e+00
SzSz        =  2.16869216589772901e-01  0.00000000000000000e+00
SxSx        =  3.19350111777505108e-01  0.00000000000000000e+00
SySy        = -4.77650003168152704e-02  0.00000000000000000e+00
```

The file format of input/output files is described in the manual page.
