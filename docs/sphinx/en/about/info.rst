Overview
=================
TeNeS (**Te** nsor **Ne** twork **S** olver) is an open-source program package for calculation of two-dimensional many-body quantum states based on the tensor network method.
This package calculates ground-state wavefunctions for user-defined Hamiltonian, and evaluates user-defined physical quantities such as magnetization and correlation functions.
For predefined models and lattices, there is a tool that makes it easy for users to generate input files.
TeNeS uses an OpenMP/MPI hybrid parallelized tensor operation library and thus can deal with large-scale calculation by using massively parallel machines.
