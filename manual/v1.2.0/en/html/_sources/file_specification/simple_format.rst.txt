---------------------------------

-  File format is
   `TOML <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/versions/ja/toml-v0.5.0.md>`__
   format.
-  The input file has four sections : ``model``, ``parameter``, ``lattice``, ``correlation`` .

   - The ``parameter`` section is copied to the standard mode input.

``model`` section
==========================

Specify the model to calculate.
In this version, spin system (``"spin"``) and bosonic system (``"boson"``) are defined.

.. csv-table::

   :widths: 5, 40, 10, 10

   ``type``, Model type ("spin" or "boson"), String, --


The parameter names such as interactions depend on the model type.

Spin system: ``"spin"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hamiltonian is described as

.. math ::

 \mathcal{H} = \sum_{\langle ij \rangle}\left[\sum_\alpha^{x,y,z} J^\alpha_{ij} S^\alpha_i S^\alpha_j + B \left(\vec{S}_i\cdot\vec{S}_j\right)^2 \right] - \sum_i \sum_\alpha^{x,y,z} h^\alpha S^\alpha_i - \sum_i D \left(S^z_i\right)^2

The parameters of the one-body terms are defined as follows.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Description", "Type", "Default"
   :widths: 5, 40, 10, 10

   ``S``,  Magnitude of the local spin,         Real (integer or half integer), 0.5
   ``hx``, "Magnetic field along :math:`S^x`,   :math:`h^x`",                   Real, 0.0
   ``hy``, "Magnetic field along :math:`S^y`,   :math:`h^y`",                   Real, 0.0
   ``hz``, "Magnetic field along :math:`S^z`,   :math:`h^z`",                   Real, 0.0
   ``D``,  "On-site spin anisotropy :math:`D`", Real,                           0.0

The exchange interaction :math:`J` can have a bond dependency.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Description", "Type", "Default"
   :widths: 5, 40, 10, 10

   ``J0``, "Exchange interaction of **0th** direction **nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J1``, "Exchange interaction of **1st** direction **nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J2``, "Exchange interaction of **2nd** direction **nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J0'``, "Exchange interaction of **0th** direction **next nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J1'``, "Exchange interaction of **1st** direction **next nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J2'``, "Exchange interaction of **2nd** direction **next nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J0''``, "Exchange interaction of **0th** direction **third nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J1''``, "Exchange interaction of **1st** direction **third nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0
   ``J2''``, "Exchange interaction of **2nd** direction **third nearest neighbor** bond", Real, 0.0

The bond direction depends on the lattice defined in the ``lattice`` section.
For a square lattice, for example, coupling constants along two bond directions can be defined, x-direction (0) and y-direction (1).
By omitting the direction number, you can specify all directions at once.
You can also specify Ising-like interaction by adding one character of `xyz` at the end.
If the same bond or component is specified twice or more, an error will occur.

 - \frac{1}{z} \left[ \sum_\alpha^{x,y,z} h^\alpha \left(S^\alpha_i + S^\alpha_j \right) + D \left(\left(S^z_i\right)^2 + \left(S^z_j\right)^2 \right) \right],
