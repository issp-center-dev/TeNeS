Magnetization process of the Heisenberg model on triangular and square lattices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, we introduce the calculation of the magnetization process of the
quantum Heisenberg model with spin :math:`S = 1/2` defined on a
triangular lattice. The Hamiltonian looks like this:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   H = J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\sum_{\alpha}^{x,y,z} {S}_i^{\alpha} {S}_j^{\alpha} - h \sum_i S_i^z\end{aligned}

Here, :math:`\langle i, j \rangle` represents the pair of nearest neighbor sites, and :math:`h` represents the magnitude of the external magnetic field applied in the :math:`z` direction. 
Let's calculate the ground state of this model and find :math:`\langle S_z \rangle\equiv \frac{1}{N_u}\sum_i^{N_u} \langle S_i^z \rangle`, where :math:`N_u` is the total number of sites in the unit cell, as a function of the magnetic field :math:`h`. To do this, the toml file ``basic.toml`` and the python script ``tutorial_magnetization.py`` are prepared in the ``sample/05_magnetization`` directory. 
The ``basic.toml`` file contains model settings and parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../sample/05_magnetization/basic.toml

The ``lattice`` section specifies a triangular lattice with the unit cell
size of :math:`3\times 3`. Here, in order to make the calculation
lighter, only ``simple update`` is performed, and the imaginary time
interval :math:`\tau` is assumed to be :math:`\tau = 0.01`. For
simplicity, :math:`J=1`. Using this basic setting file,
tutorial_magnetization.py calculates the magnetization when the magnetic
field is swept.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../sample/05_magnetization/tutorial_magnetization.py

In this script, the magnetic field :math:`h` is changed in steps of
:math:`0.25` from :math:`0` to :math:`5`, and the ground state energy
and :math:`\langle S_z \rangle` are calculated and output to ``energy.dat``
and ``magnetization.dat``, respectively. In order to see what happens when the number of time steps for simple update is changed, calculations are also performed with :math:`100`, :math:`200`, :math:`500`, :math:`1000`, and
:math:`2000` steps for each magnetic field. 
In order to reduce the amount of calculation, the information of the wave function obtained with a small number of steps is stored in ``tensor_save``, and this is used as the initial state for the calculation of a larger number of steps.
For example, the python script first performs a calculation with the number of time steps set to 100, and output the result. 
Then, it perform a calculation with the number of time steps set to 200 using the wave function at the end of the calculation of the number of steps 100. The
script consequently reduce the amount of the calculation by 100 steps for the latter in the directory.

Let's actually run it. After passing through a path to tenes in advance,
execute calculation by typing as follows.

::

    python tutorial_magnetization.py

The calculation will finish within a few hours if you use a notebook PC
using a single processor. After the calculation is completed, start up
gnuplot and type

::

    load 'plot.gp'

to obtain the magnetization curve as shown in the right panel of
:numref:`fig_tutorial5_triangular`. In a similar way,

::

    load 'plot_ene.gp'

we obtain the ground-state energy as shown in the left panel of
:numref:`fig_tutorial5_triangular` .

As can be seen from the result for a sufficiently large number of steps
(for example, 2000 steps), a plateau structure occurs in the
magnetization process at the magnetization of :math:`1/3` of the
saturation magnetization :math:`\langle S_z \rangle = 0.5`. On this
plateau, spins on the three lattices form a periodic magnetic structure
with :math:`\uparrow`, :math:`\uparrow`, :math:`\downarrow`, and a spin
gap is generated.  This plateau structure is unique to the triangular lattice. To see whether the accuracy of calculation is enough or not, it is helpful
to check the step dependence of energy. In principle, the ground-state
energy should decrease as the number of steps increases, but in some
magnetic fields, the calculated energy increases. This is a sign that
the calculation accuracy is not good. It is presumed that it is
necessary to increase the bond dimension.

Next, let's perform the calculation for a model on a square lattice. Use the toml file ``basic_square.toml`` and the python script ``tutorial_magnetization_square.py`` in the ``sample/05_magnetization`` directory.
The content of ``basic_square.toml`` is the same as ``basic.toml`` except that the ``lattice`` section has been changed as follows.

::

    [lattice]
    type = "square lattice"
    L = 2
    W = 2

To perform the calculation, type::

    python tutorial_magnetization_square.py

After the calculation is completed, start up gnuplot and type

::

    load 'plot_square.gp'

Then, the magnetization curve shown in the right panel of
:numref:`fig_tutorial5_square` is obtained. In a similar way, by typing the following command,

::

    load 'plot_ene_square.gp'

you will obtain the ground-state energy as shown in the left panel of
:numref:`fig_tutorial5_square`. The calculation is almost converged at 2000
steps, and it can be seen that the plateau structure does not appear
unlike the triangular lattice Heisenberg model. Since the energy
generally decreases as the number of steps is increased, it is assumed
that the calculation accuracy is sufficiently high.
