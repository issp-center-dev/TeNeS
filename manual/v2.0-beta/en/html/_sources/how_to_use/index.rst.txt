Usage
***************************

``tenes``, the main program of TeNeS, needs an input file to define the model, order of operations, etc.
For ease of use to make the input file, the following script is provided (the schematic flow is shown :numref:`fig_tenes_flow`):

- ``tenes_std`` : A tool that generates an input file to execute ``tenes``. An input file of ``tenes_std`` defines a lattice model etc. by yourself according to a predetermined format.

-  ``tenes_simple``: A tool that generates input files for ``tenes_std`` from another simpler input file which specifies lattice model predefined.
  
In order to simulate other models and/or lattices than predefined ones, you should create the input file of ``tenes_std`` and convert it.
Please see :doc:`../file_specification/index` for details on the input files of TeNeS.
