- how to run
    - `export PATH=${WHERE_TENES_INSTALLED}/bin:$PATH`
    - `sh run.sh`
    - `python3 ./calcspec.py` for calculating specific heat by spline interpolation of energy
    - `gnuplot -persist plot_e.plt` for generate a figure of energy
    - `gnuplot -persist plot_c.plt` for generate a figure of specific heat
    - `gnuplot -persist plot_mz.plt` for generate a figure of manetization alog Sz
    - `gnuplot -persist plot_mx.plt` for generate a figure of magnetization alog Sx
