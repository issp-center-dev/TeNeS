- how to run
    - `export PATH=${WHERE_TENES_INSTALLED}/bin:$PATH`
    - `sh run.sh`
    - `gnuplot -persist plot_e.plt` for generate a figure of energy
    - `gnuplot -persist plot_c.plt` for generate a figure of specific heat
- model
    - Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice
- Inputs
    - `simple_gapless.toml`
        - Finite temperature simulation of isotropic Kitaev Heisenberg model
            - `J0x = -1`
            - `J1y = -1`
            - `J2z = -1`
        - Note that the gapless model is difficult to reach the ground state
    - `simple_gapfull.toml`
        - Finite temperature simulation of anisotropic Kitaev Heisenberg model
            - `J0x = -0.3`
            - `J1y = -0.3`
            - `J2z = -2.4`
